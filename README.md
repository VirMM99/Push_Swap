~**DESCRIPTION**~

Push_Swap is a program that its fuction is to sort in order a series of random numbers.

The main part of the project is to order in the minimum number of movements specify in the subject.

~**INSTRUCTIONS**~

Things to take into account before starting the Push_swap:

- Create your Makefile. You will need it to compile you project.
- Get ready your push_swap.h, the progran will teke fron it how many funtios you have,
	the includes you will use and lists. With this you will have your library ready to
	used as an include in your *.c.
- You will need to have the checker that 42 provides you, to check if your movements are
	OK or KO. You can download the one that works for your computer, Linux or OS.
- (Optional) There is a visualicer that can be useful tou check if you are doing your
	movements ok and if they are in the range that 42 asked in the subject. You can see
	both stacks with the numers moving between them in real time.

~**RESOURCES**~

A LOT of peer to peer. Apart from that, I used this video in youtube that explain several important concepts, that are VERY important in this project : ['push_swap TUTORIAL!' By 
Thuggonaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRvipSG4Mmk) 

I also check the push_swap of different collegues that are in GitHub:

- 0xARCOS
- luna7111
- ksudyn
- 7pixeles
This are a few I checked among others!

I use AI to clean my code, with the help of a peer, because it was the fisrt time I was using it. It was more to clean and to clarify my functions.
